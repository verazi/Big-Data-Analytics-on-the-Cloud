Ban people from owning more than one property first. Ban people from buying real estate as investments. That's the issue. The ONLY issue.

There's a mention of affordable housing in the story, but the way it's written, sounds like - nope, not this project.

The 22 parking spaces is short sighted, there is no on street parking close by. It is walking distance to GO transit and right on a bus route. Those are the types of things the city should be negotiating with the developer instead of standing pat on a six story zoning which precedes the housing crisis (although likely contributed to it over the years).

They strong-armed merchants with anticompetitive demands.  They bought and destroyed companies that competed with them.  They provided only importers and not exporters for critical apps. They became a tyranical and they ate most of an industry for as long as they could.  He ended up a billionaire because of it.</p><p>I wonder what things would have been like if those competing businesses had not been destroyed by Microsoft's monopolistic, domineering behavior?  Might we have had better tech?  Less lock-in?  Less planned obsolescence of technology via withhiolding software as a means to drive new hardware sales?  MS showed other companies that they could do that and not lose their customers. </p><p>Sorry, I'm channeling my inner Louis Rossman...</p>", "created_at": "2025-05-11T22:44:55+00:00"}

Usually people end up reaching for me through her or relatives because I haven't had the reflex of exchanging contact. And I am rarely the one doing the first step in that direction.

Housing alternatives? Many folk don't actually want to 'own' a property. It can be an albatross. My view is that an increase in the supply of social housing at a cost commensurate with the current rates of Housing Benefit (which also needs an overhaul) would ease the pressure. An added bonus would be to decrease the stranglehold those materialistic capitalists have on our day to day. (but that's my politics lah!).</p>", "created_at": "2025-05-04T07:20:04+00:00"}
