it took me those 3 weeks to try to understand it that is why i am giving my analysis about it only today because there is a lot of information p hr p in every country governments have two functions p ol li govern the country li li engage in activities to pursue re election li ol p in some countries the function 2 is minimized because the political system doesn #39 t allow re election p p in australia the function 2 is maximized because there is no limit on how many times a government can be re elected for example john howard was 12 years in government p p so when the election is coming the government focuses almost exclusively in pursuing re election i guess the government would secretly admit that some measures taken by them are not justified if they were focused only in good government p p i think we are in that situation in australia right now and this budget is only intended for winning re election i guess our government would admit quot oh yes if we were not looking re election the budget would be completely different quot p hr p strong why is that this budget is only intended for winning re election strong p p because it has the things that the liberal party probably expects are desirable by voters at least the voters that they expect to win votes from p ol li p they are reducing taxes effective immediately which is very out of normality a government usually reduces taxes when the surplus is achieved our government is reducing taxes when we are still in deficit i think our government would admit that if the elections were not coming they wouldn #39 t have reduced taxes effected immediately but they would have waited a few years p li li p remember a href morrison in santa costume in quot the daily telegraph quot a he tried to mean that he is increasing spending well they are actually increasing spending in some measures in this budget i think our government would admit that if the elections were not coming they wouldn #39 t have increased the spending i think that because i feel that some of the new spending measures are not backed by strong justifications p li ol p you may say quot wow our government is increasing spending while reducing taxes that #39 s amazing quot well that is what some newspapers would want you to think but you need to get the details to see the full story because the devil is in the details p p i think the budget is made in that way to be perceived as increasing spending all that was about quot perception quot because perception is a lot in politics so there are a lot of measures in the budget p hr p strong why is that there are a lot of measures in the budget strong p p it can be seen as an approximation from the number of pages in the budget documents the main budget document is called quot budget paper no 2 quot and the one for 2018 2019 is located here a href p the number of pages has been increasing every year in recent years p ul li 2016 2017 188 pages li li 2017 2018 206 pages li li 2018 2019 223 pages li ul p so there you see that our government is putting more information in the budget documents every year recently and that is because of new spending measures to satisfy the desires of the voters to win their votes in the next elections i guess if our government were not looking re election then the number of pages would have remained almost the same every year p hr p you may say quot that #39 s wonderful there #39 s more new spending in the budget isn #39 t there quot the answer is no it #39 s not new spending p p strong why is that there is no new spending in the budget strong p p many of the new spending measures use money coming from quot within the existing resources quot so it is not new the government departments need to do more with the same money p p that can be seen if we look for the phrase quot within the existing resources quot in the budget documents quot budget paper no 2 quot and count how many times it appears p ul li 2014 2015 256 pages 13 times times per page 0 051 li li 2015 2016 216 pages 12 times times per page 0 055 li li 2016 2017 188 pages 15 times times per page 0 079 li li 2017 2018 206 pages 15 times times per page 0 072 li li 2018 2019 223 pages 20 times times per page 0 089 li ul p so you see that each year the quot times per page quot value increases meaning the phrase quot within the existing resources quot appears more frequently meaning that our government tries to do more with the same money p hr p strong how is that our government tries to do more with the same money strong p p firing public servants
