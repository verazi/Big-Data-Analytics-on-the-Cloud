ago now moving to melbourne p p i #39 m looking for advice on which are the areas i should be checking out to live in that include p ul li good proximity to the cbd or at least near good public transport to the cbd i am a consultant and will be servicing mid large companies like financial amp software companies which i #39 m assuming are concentrated in the cbd right li li single people in the 25 40 age range li li a good selection of restaurants and laid back pubs i prefer a neighborhood scene where the local places are chill but still good spots for meeting people and being social i love meeting random people when i go out li li good rental accommodations that aren #39 t too expensive li li good supermarkets grocers that sell good ingredients bit of a chef li li safe li li other fun going out options around there are a nice bonus like karaoke cinemas arcades museums shops li li good selection of ethnic restaurants a nice bonus li li being around water beach or river a nice bonus li ul p any tips on around how much to expect to spend for a relatively small 1 2 bed 1 bath flat would also be appreciated p p even outside of places to live i #39 m especially interested in where the best quot scenes quot are for meeting people in a non meat markety way i #39 ve been spoiled by living in austin around some bars that are incredibly social where i #39 ve been able to meet people who became my friends and hoping to find places like that in melbourne i know a few people in melbourne but they aren #39 t exactly social butterflies p p websites what are the best local sites for restaurant nightlife reviews something like yelp com would be ideal for jobs specifically it contracts is seek com au the main one or are there others i should look at is gumtree the only place worth going to for classifieds p p extra bonus question are there any decent quot american quot bars in melbourne it would be nice to find a place that shows nfl and us college football games since i #39 ve gotten a bit addicted since being over here p p edit so i #39 ve been in melbourne a few days and have spent the last two entire days walking the suburbs literally i #39 ve walked about 40 miles through the neighborhoods it was a great way to get to know the neighborhoods and how they differ here #39 s my opinion on what i #39 ve seen in that limited time maybe it will help some other folks p p strong richmond strong i found it a little too i dunno industrial the southern part of the suburb was a lot of commercial storefronts like furniture etc there were some ok places around there but transitioning into the north part of the suburb it got pretty sketchy overall the people i saw walking around in richmond were the sketchiest of all the places i looked someone mentioned a drug element at night but i saw a bit of it during the day too i em loved em victoria street for the asian shops and interesting flavor but i wouldn #39 t want to live very close to it p p strong collingwood strong em loved em smith street it #39 s a scene that #39 s right up my alley somewhat alternative hip but still really cool and not too cliquish the east side of the suburb seemed a tad gritty a la richmond but i #39 ve decided i want to be somewhere that #39 s easy access to smith st and brunswick street in fitzroy p p strong fitzroy strong also loved brunswick street between that and smith i think that #39 s my type of nightlife brunswick st seems a little more mainstream than smith st but still a bit on the alternative side i realized last time i was here i went out a couple times on brunswick just had no idea where i was at the time the residential on the north side of fitzroy or the south side of fitzroy north seems like a good candidate for me p p strong carlton strong i #39 ve been to the touristy end of lygon st a few times before and wasn #39 t sure i #39 d find the area livable but i really liked the north end of carlton the south end is all student ish tiny apartment accoms but the north side and the south side of carlton north had some really cool 2 1 townhouses that seemed like the type of place i #39 d like living p p strong carlton north and fitzroy north strong very nice areas but way too residential with too little nightlife to be a good option at least on the north side i think the south end of both areas is where i #39 ll end up though p p strong brunswick strong i was expecting something a little more funky and happening it was mostly dead on the saturday i was there a few cool ethnic restaurants and second hand stores but not really my scene i #39 ve been there at night last time i was here and liked the nightlife but it was not my scene the residential area in brunswick east was nice but very quot residential quot for my tastes you can definitely get more place for the money though p p strong northcote strong recommended to me by a few people i was expecting the northcote thornbury area to be really funky arty but was a little underwhelmed the main drag didn #39 t have that much happening and although i saw a couple cool big places available for rent at better prices than the more central areas i think ultimately the area is too far from the city with too little happening for me i did pop into the peacock hotel which was really jamming on saturday afternoon p p strong st kilda strong as mentioned before i was underwhelmed by the area in terms of things happening it #39 s a bit touristy for me too the houses are awesome and it #39 s a beautiful area and near the water but overall it felt too self contained and divorced from the rest of melbourne p p strong southbank strong not really my scene i decided i really don #39 t want to live in a big apartment building p p i still have a few places to check out like prahran but so far i am fairly certain i want to live in the north end of carlton fitzroy or the south end of carlton north fitzroy north is that the right terminology it #39 s how google maps labels it but i haven #39 t heard any locals call it quot carlton north quot the rectangle i think is the target area is bounded by lygon to the west newry to the north smith to the east and faraday to the south that gives me walking access to lygon brunswick smith streets as well as very easy access to the city and great public transport i expect to pay around 400 500 pw for a 2 1 townhouse and saw several of those up for rent that were surprisingly nice on streets that seemed pretty quiet and safe considering their proximity to the nightlife p p anyway thanks everyone for your help and input and to newcomers to melbourne i em highly em recommend going on a big walk through all the suburbs you are thinking of living in it really helped me get a feel for the neighborhoods and for how much they change from block to block p div sc_on", "created_at": "2011-01-06T16:27:16", "tags": "melbourne", "state": "VIC", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_score": 0.9999}}

arcade p p so here #39 s a quick and easy map that i #39 ve used on some of my walking tours in the past with annotations about what you #39 ll find there and what kind of clothes price range notes about the stores themselves p p a href p in list form some of my favourite places to shop for p p strong suits strong p p strong godwin charli strong 800 for an excellent quality well fitted suit although nowhere near as good as p p strong harrolds strong 1300 5000 for fully canvassed highest quality suits that will make you look better than you #39 ve ever looked in your life don #39 t think i included this one on the map it #39 s at strong 101 collins st strong if you need shirts their in house brand starts with an x don #39 t remember is made in the same factory same fabrics as dior shirts for about 1 3 the price around 220 and will do some alterations for you for free so they fit like a dream can #39 t speak more highly of this place plus they give you drinks whiskey coffee etc while you shop don #39 t be scared just because it #39 s a high end place the staff are amazing ask for julian if he #39 s there and there are quite a few reasonably priced things there p p strong casual strong p p strong plane strong manchester lane is by far my favourite place for casual stuff in melbourne prices are ridiculously good for what you get 15 for great quality cuts in basic t shirts 80 chinos 25 wallets 80 casual shirts etc decent shoes and sunglasses and accessories too p p strong somewhere store strong royal arcade is a close second on my favourites hidden up a staircase in royal arcade near little collins st full of swedish clothes that have minimalistic clean functional designs em the em place to go if you want an assortment of dr denim cheap monday tiger and other swedish stuff the owner gustaf is a gentleman and a scholar heaps of jeans chinos shirts tees jumpers jackets accessories etc great place to bring girls p p strong incu strong flinders lane is another of my favourites a streetwear style store similar to what you #39 ll find in fat but with a lot more variety better range of stuff a wide range of watches cameras sunglasses accessories and whatnot as well absolutely love this store p p strong jeans strong p p strong nudie strong lt collins st make probably my favourite jeans in the world great cuts fantastic quality and decent prices for what you

140 and other well priced jeans p p strong shoes strong p p strong luisa uomo strong 161 collins st inside opposite the food court is the absolute first port of call when buying shoes ever bought a pair of shoes from aquila florsheim etc worn it for a few months and then they fall apart that #39 s because the quality is crappy the soles are glued on and the leather is cheap overpriced for what you get instead get a good pair of hand made shoes high quality construction and attention to detail that will last for years traditionally these shoes will cost 400 1000 luisa uomo is great because it #39 s the discount store of luisa on russell st that sell european shoes like armani church loakes etc at the end of each season all the stock goes to uomo and are discounted 50 80 stock changes constantly and it can be difficult to find things in your size but always check it out to see if you can find a bargain if you can find a pair of churches for lt 400 strong buy them strong as they will last 10 years honest hold them in your hands you can feel the construction material quality p p strong rm williams strong collins st the place to go if you want a pair of chelsea boots they #39

electricity a fridge an oven a stove a microwave a washing machine a computer a stereo and a tv with a hd digital whizz bang setup and too many free to air channels that it s hard to know what to watch anymore p p there is a car parked in my driveway and i own it there is a primary school across the road and my children attend that for free because i m on a pensioner concession card and they are provided with a broad education that covers numeracy literacy sports and the arts and should you choose religion p p there is a bulk billing doctor and public hospital nearby that will provide me the appropriate medical care if the need arises in the closest city i have access to doctors surgeons medical equipment and specialists that will provide me with the best care just because in this country it is my civil right to live a healthy life p p i may never own a house but i live in a country where there are systems in place to provide public housing refuge from domestic violence or homelessness and a rehabilitation accommodation to recover from drug amp alcohol addiction p p i may not go to university but i live in a country where education is not simply a privileged for the rich but an option for most people willing to participate there are tertiary and vocational training tafe course apprenticeships traineeships and community certificate programs available for all p p i make mistakes we all do in one way or another for some of us our mistakes do not affect the fundamentals of our basic existence for others their freedom and civil liberties are compromised as a result of their choices i live in a country where we have access to legal advice and representation even if the defendant has no money no home and no hope we have the right to a trial in a court of law and we have the right to appeal that trial should we disagree with its outcome should some of us end up being imprisoned at some point the prison we are sent to will have heating clean running water

is why i document my gratitude like this being thankful softens the hard facts of life should it all get to be too much for some of us we can open the phonebook yes they still make them and see a section with help lines these are services with counselling some are provided 24 hours a day 7 days a week and we all have the ability to pick up the phone make a free call and get help no matter what our financial or emotional situation may be no matter what race or religion we are no matter whom we are what we ve done what we want to do p p i live in a country where my body is my own and nobody can take that from me there are laws in place to ensure that should i have sex it is with my permission and at my discretion i have the freedom to wear what i want to fatten myself starve myself tattoo myself pleasure myself pierce myself poison myself or spoil myself the only accountability i have is to the law and to my loved ones and to myself p p i may not be rich i may not be smart i may not be far up the social ladder but the only limitations in my life are the ones i place upon myself that is not because i am fifty different kinds of awesome it is because of the country that i live in the country we all care about if we didn t care about australia then none of us would watch read search the news multiple times a day none of us would vote let alone debate endlessly for decades over politics we wouldn t have sport heroes to personify our pride we wouldn t support them or their team with such passion if we didn t care about our country we wouldn t protest for the greater good we wouldn t hold our leaders and our media accountable to standards that we set as a society if we didn t love our country you probably still wouldn t be this p p we all have the right to be ourselves but we all have the obligation to be grateful we have so much community wealth more than any other country i feel safe on the streets i trust the police i believe in our government systems yet i question and criticise because that is how i was raised to speak my mind to participate in democracy to be grateful for what i have to remember there are those in the world that have less than i could imagine p p i am not middle class i am a low income uneducated and unemployed my couches are from the salvos i sometimes have to get food vouchers just to get dinner on the table i can t afford to battle with the price of petrol so i often walk to where i need to be i shop at op shops kmart and best n less i only learned what louboutins were a week ago i sacrifice luxuries that others take for granted but i don t mind i try not to let disadvantage upset me because in truth i am so thankful for what i have for what being an australia entitles me to p p thank you for reading this i would love

thought i ought to do my part as a fellow redditor to impart some sort of a justified part as a human being to another p p those of you who #39 ve been around in melb city will probably have seen posters urging melbournians to vote for mayorship and deputy mayorship there #39 s one specific deputy lord mayor whose poster i #39 ve seen in the city that has made me so angry because he has tried to cheat me of my money this guy is john so seen on posters to quot vote 1 quot alongside with gary singer as the lord mayor p p i #39 ll retract back a little bit so as to give you a little back story that can help me justify this anger p p i #39 m an international student studying here in melbourne and managed to find a relatively cheap room to rent with my room mate john was my landlord he #39 s a nice decent chap very good with people and i thought em okay this guy seems reliable enough em together with my room mate we signed a 6 months lease contract with him our lease was to start on july 2011 to end on jan 2012 a couple of months into my lease it was around september #39 11 that i figured i should head back to my hometown in november #39 11 and to stay there for 2 months before heading back to melbourne in jan #39 12 p p now it was in early october #39 11 after finalising my tickets that i told john that i #39 d be leaving in nov #39 11 note at least 4 weeks before leaving the premise and i asked if there could be an arrangement sorted out between the both of us as i didn #39 t want to pay 2 months of rent since i wouldn #39 t be living in melbourne we agreed that given i had told him about my departure at least 4 weeks in prior he #39 d gladly sort it out for me told me that he #39 d find tenants to stay in my room however the lease would still be under my name i had to pay him 2 months rent before i left and he #39 d pay it all back to me including my bond money when i got back to melbourne strong note bond money should have been submitted to rta it should not be in the landlord #39 s hands at all strong makes me think about how sneaky the arrangement of giving him the bond money is i #39 m not too sure of the legalities involved in terms of real estate so i naively agreed thinking quot em this guy is my landlord he #39 s nice he wouldn #39 t try anything heinous em quot so all i had to do was to pay 2 months of rent strong in cash strong and he #39 d kindly sort everything out for me strong mistake 1 strong all these agreement was done over the phone there was no black and white in email or text nothing terms of agreement between him and i strong mistake 2 strong i paid in cold hard cash there #39 s no proof of transaction between myself and john yes i was a fucking pig head i didn #39 t know better was naive and had no clue p p fast forward to my arrival in melbourne in 2012 i got into contact with john and asked for my money back this was a lump sum of money about 2k 3k and i was anxious in getting my money back from him to my shock he told me he could only pay me back a measly sum of 300 because i had owed him the money due to the lack of tenants which he wasn #39 t able to find to pay the rent and because the lease was still under my name the cost of the number of days weeks he couldn #39 t find a tenant would be deducted from the money i had trusted him with at this point i was angry because he promised me i feel silly even typing #39 he promised me #39 such naivety i was scared and lost because as an international student that money was a huge sum and i didn #39 t know what i could do all i wanted was to get my money back he seemed adamant didn #39 t seem like he was going to budge in giving my parents #39 hard earned money back he took his time to reply my texts of nervousness in wanting all of my rent and bond money back i was pissing in my pants wondering how i was going to let my parents know i #39 ve fucked up big time and left a huge chunk of money with a landlord who knew the law well enough to get away with cheating a student of her money without any repercussions since he had covered all forms of potential liabilities i e agreeing over the phone transactions in cash p p i decided to seek legal advice from my school and i embarrassingly made a fool of myself by bursting into tears just 10 minutes after meeting my school #39 s lawyer i was a hideous crying baby anyway she gave me a list of government aids that i could report him to and hopefully with slim chances due to my own stupidity of not getting things agreed on paper or email or texts get my full amount of money back from john to cut the story short i sent john a text telling him that i was going to head to one of the government aid i #39 m sorry i can #39 t remember the name of it this was a year ago unless i got my money back lo and behold he immediately tried calling me numerous times which my school #39 s lawyer advised not to pick up because he was going to try to negotiate with me over the phone em only text or email because it serves as a form of proof em he eventually relented and promptly gave my full amount of rent money back on the day itself not before trying to convince me to have my money returned in cash again so that there isn #39 t any proof of transaction between him and i which my school #39 s lawyer forewarned me not to accept em only by e transaction em she says the ordeal ended with him sending me a text saying that he thought we were on such good terms and was disappointed that i would resort to such drastic measures i e calling in government aid to get my money back you know what fuck you john if we had been on such good terms you wouldn #39 t have tried to cheat an international student who knew nothing about estate laws of her money p p this happened a year ago while my credibility may be questioned i #39 ve since deleted his messages em should not have done that em since it could prove my credibility my intention really isn #39 t to make anyone believe me in fact i don #39 t even think anyone is going to read this my intention is to question john as a deputy lord mayor if melbournians can truly trust him to do what #39 s right not at the expense of his selfish interests but for genuine interest for the public i don #39 t know if this is his first attempt in trying to cheat an international student of her money or one of his many i was lucky or unlucky enough to catch his misdeed how many of us would be as lucky as i was how would we be able to trust him with the guarding of state #39 s funds will he genuinely put the city #39 s interests over his

inside. sc_off div class md p i #39 m posting this to give people who may live in the area a warning about two kids young men who attempted to mug me earlier this morning p p at about 12 15am this morning i got off the train at seddon station to make my way home from a friends 21st after getting off the train i began walking down pentiland parade so i could go down charles street p p halfway down to parade i could hear two people walking behind me they were moving faster than i was though i didn #39 t think too much of it one called out to me asking if i knew the time i don #39 t own a phone and was dressed up at the time costume party meaning i had no pockets and all my stuff was in a backpack i called out to him that it was quarter past 12 since that was the time my train had pulled in p p at this they started walking faster and i sped up in response now somewhat nervous i turned onto charles and now they had caught up with me the two were obviously young around 15 18 the boy who #39 d called out around 170cm black began walking beside me and his friend 160cm ish white directly behind i was told to stop but continued without acknowledging them the taller one pushed me slightly and asked me where my phone and wallet were at this he took something from his own pocket because of my glasses and the dim light i couldn #39 t identify what it was p p the one behind me now had a hand on my bag in response i swung an arm out from the strap and rested it under my other arm giving me a better grip on it and allowing me to drop it if i felt really threatened the one beside me said i had 5 to stop 4 3 2 i stopped and rested my hand on a gate and told the kid i was stopping because now i was home p p the kid behind me still trying to hold my bag now told me to let them take it and pulled i laughed nervous as hell though not showing it and told him it wasn #39 t worth the hassle i #39 d give him then asked if their parents knew what they were doing the black kid then hit me across the back of the neck with his weapon which i believe was a tennis ball or something wrapped in a sock it hurt but wasn #39 t rock hard and was not sharp at the same time the other kid began pullling much harder on my bag p p i couldn #39 t get the gate open so after a second i yelled out loudly dad the black kid now beside his friend swung at my face though i lent back and it missed i assume he wanted to knock my glasses off or he had shitty aim the other pulled on my bag once more then they ran off turning back onto pentiland p p now alone mostly unharmed and still in possession of my bag i walked off having completely lied about the location of my home a large part of me wanted to run but with big clunky boots and a long cape i was worried they would hear me and return after a block or so i calmed down and looked behind me no sign of #39 em while walking past sabroso i saw a small group of people leaving the club i #39 d like to say i warned them about the kids but i wasn #39 t thinking clearly and a pair went off towards pentiland i really hope they didn #39 t encounter those kids and seriously regret not warning them p p i #39 m home now and have had a chance to check myself my bag is still closed and everything inside it safe my neck has a slight red mark though isn #39 t injured and should be fine tomorrow aside from some nerves i really got out of it all okay but i wanted to in part warn other locals about them and also just talk myself through what had happened so i could work out what i did right wrong thanks for reading this if you have for reference i am a 20 year old male who would be obviously identified as a nerd and potentially an easy target particularily considering the glasses and syndrome costume p p tl dr 20 year old male was almost mugged by two young men aged between 15 18 near seddon station the muggers did not appear to have a deadly weapon though that does not mean they don #39 t they ran off at the potential of a difficult attack though again this does not mean they will again in the future p p i kinda want to mention what i think is important here they asked for the time both to get me to slow down and to see if i got out a phone if it is late and someone asks you for the time do not get out a phone to check offer them a best guess and do not stop walking to do so if they ask you to check tell them you don #39 t have something to check on p p when they caught up to me i still did not stop though i did not verbally argue with them when i stopped i did it because i felt threatened enough by their presence that i was worried i would be attacked for running calling for help may have been a bad idea as those kinds of calls can be easily ignored both by attackers and potential assistance by calling for someone who i knew and was apparently nearby they assumed they would have to fight for what they believed would be a very meagre reward p p i am very glad i claimed to be near to both my home and my father but i also feel incredible stupid for gaming them by asking them if their parents knew what they were doing it was a stupid thing designed only to get me very temporary satisfaction at the risk of angering them a great deal finally i feel awful for not warning other people in the area of a possible threat against them allowing them to be prepared should they have encountered the boys i also do feel somewhat bad for associating myself with a strangers home and i intend to knock on their door at a resonable hour tomorrow and explain the sitaution in case those boys decide to damage them home in relatation for my actions p p sorry for the wall of text i really just wanted to get this out of my head and spoken somewhere have a good night all and stay safe p div sc_on", "created_at":

can we remember a man central to the legend whose own name is now being misused once again and alongside him the diggers that served not only abroad but which toiled at home for our betterment p p from an old white hat newsletter strong the return of sir john monash to melbourne strong p p em john monash was born in west melbourne moved to jerilderie for part of his childhood where it is possible he met ned kelly before returning to melbourne to continue his studies in engineering he soon became an expert in the construction methods of the new building material known as reinforced concrete or more colloquially to australians who loved to abbreviate everything as reo he was involved with the building of the princes bridge and the design of the sandridge bridge come wwi he went off to gallipoli he was not a career soldier but had already achieved the rank of an officer in the volunteers after gallipoli he was sent to the western front by this time his organising skill had been well recognised even though the influential journalist keith murdoch and war historian bean lobbied against his promotion he was not a populist shake everyone s hands and call them mate and look out for the photo opportunity sort of leader the british generals were prepared to experiment with various strategies using the troops as cannon fodder monash had grown up designing bridges you get only one chance to get it right he planned his battles accordingly artillery planes infantry and tanks were planned as part of a co ordinated project each playing their part at their pre ordained time this included american tanks and to my knowledge americans who rightly pride themselves at never fighting under a foreign flag have only ever once been led into battle by a foreign officer john monash em p p em as for the australians who at this stage had been sent over the parapets time and again into the teeth of deadly machine gun fire officers didn t occupy a place of high regard in their thinking except for monash somehow in the middle of all this mayhem he was able to arrange for a hot meal to be sent to men in the front trenches if he thought that was important and knew how to organise it maybe he was different and he was em p p em his organising and tactical abilities led to him being knighted on the field of battle by the reigning king of england the first time that had happened in hundreds of years he had come a long way since his early childhood in melbourne playing in the flagstaff gardens at the end of the war various british and australian officers were pushed or pushed themselves into the limelight but not monash however the men knew what was what and who they were prepared to march behind during the long slow business of demobbing many australian troops remained in europe they had a reputation as larrikins lacking in formal discipline and aplomb several marches of the colonials were arranged through london sir john issued a message to his men it is only four miles and will last an hour and a quarter it is not too much to ask every man to grip himself remember you represent the great and immortal australian army corps every man should try and look as he ought and feel proud of his division and the australian army londoners agreed that the amateur volunteers of the australian army could when led by their own officer who shunned pomp put professional career soldiers in the shade when it suited them and when led by a man they utterly respected which wasn t all that often at this time monash also realised that the men would need to go back to new jobs and set up a complete education scheme to prepare them for their new lives em p p em monash was feted in london and offers came from around the world for potentially prestigious positions but practically nothing from australia and the government seemed intent on snubbing him however monash declared that he was returning to melbourne boats travel slowly but word travels fast repatriated diggers from around australia payed their way to melbourne to welcome him home they had left their lives as farmhands and bookkeepers and wharfies and teachers and seen things that no person should ever be forced to see and come in contact with what can happen in back lanes in paris and done things that only a person who knows they will probably die a horrible death tomorrow can do and returned to a sheltered family life which knew nothing of suchthings and of which they would probably divulge nothing for the rest of their lives except in part when they were back in that other dreadful cheerful sad heroic bunch of mates who understood and sir john was coming back he might move in different circles now but he understood the ship docked in port melbourne on boxing day and sir john was taken by lighter to st kilda pier there he was mobbed by the men who carried him shoulder high to the boulevard that now carries the name of a vc winner in fact it was this vc winner albert jacka who said of monash as a soldier he s like one of ourselves and doesn t like swank the parade continued along fitzroy street through south melbourne and along swanston street where the crowds cheered him every block of the way he had been greeted by various mayors but the federal parliament which at that time sat in melbourne was conspicuously absent and there was no sign of prime minister hughes em p p em there were two elephants in the room the first was that john monash was jewish and that did not sit well with certain parts of the establishment as to the men they had left an australia where they had been taught that catholics and protestant could perhaps be on speaking terms but those of the opposite persuasion had to be treated with suspicion in the trenches they soon learned that it was of no concern whether the man next to you was protestant catholic jewish or kalathumpian what mattered was could he be depended on and the men knew john monash could be depended on the second elephant was more threatening monash was now clearly the most popular and respected man in australia any job in australia was his for the taking including possibly prime minister politicians were anxious to recommend him for a job in the public service public servants were keen to recommend him for a job in the private sector the magnates of the private sector were keen to recommend him for a permanent job in the military the career military were keen to recommend him for a position of high honours overseas em p p em the day after his return sir john took off his military uniform donned his civvies and returned to the job in his engineering company it was a strong message to the men that it was time for them to do the same offers continued to pour in but before long he surprised and relieved many by accepting a job heading up the newly formed state electricity commission which was then a small floundering organisation he argued that the prosperity of victoria and therefore the employment prospects of his men depended on a statewide electricity supply he sat down and started to plan out a system that would see victoria though the next 50 years one expects if he was offered the job today he would look at all he could find out about climate change and renewable energies investigate what changes various plans might have on individuals and organisations and start planning for the next 50 years nowadays it is difficult to walk through central melbourne without being reminded of the legacy of sir john monash the dome in the grand reading room of the state library was designed by him even though it was another company that eventually built it the mural of prometheus in john monash house now renamed princes bridge and sandridge bridge where he cut his teeth as an engineer the shrine which wouldn t have existed without his drive then of course there is the university that appropriately bears his name the anzac day parade of which he was the initiator as we have described in a previous newsletter here he is marching along the tramlines at one such parade em p p em but you might say that was all a long time ago even the location where he was born in west melbourne has no plaque and has long functioned as a house of ill repute surely people have largely forgotten him not so em p p em when decision makers meet at the peak body for engineers in melbourne and sit at the board table it would be difficult for them to make a decision without being influenced by the simple statement by monash in large lettering which takes up most of one wall of that room adopt as your fundamental creed that you will equip yourself for life not solely for your own benefit but for the benefit of the whole community em p p em i think it is fair to say that sir john monash s return to melbourne has had an effect that was bigger than the beatles em a href p this just goes to show how far back the reach of media moguls extends rupert murdoch #39 s own father was ready to dirty another man #39 s image to retain his own share of influence it #39 s probably a good thing that monash chose to take up the establishment of the secv rather than enter the public life in doing so he provided meaningful work for many returned servicemen and together they provided possibly an even greater direct service to our nation than their sacrifices in europe and now monash a consummate professional and rational man has been muddied again by politicians intent on riding on his legacy to further their personal agendas now in the spirit of the anzac legend can we share stories of veterans abroad or at home and how we remember them p p i #39 ll go first in comments p div sc_on", "created_at": "2018-04-25T21:28:17", "tags":
